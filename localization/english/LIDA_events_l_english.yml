LIDA.100.t: "Pardon my Bold Proposal"
LIDA.100.desc: "You chance upon [affairs_partner.GetFullNameRegnal], who on seeing you makes his way purposefully towards you. It seems he was looking for you. \n\n"[ROOT.Char.GetFullNameRegnal]! It must be fate that we meet on this day. If I may be so bold, I have a proposal that would be desirable for us both." Saying so, he parts his cloak, showing a pouch bulging with presumably gold. You inadvertantly also spot another not-insignificant bulge that hints at his intention. Following your gaze, he follows up, "that I'd like to discuss with you - #bold in private#!." "

Upon being untied, a lustrous avalanche of coins spill from it and light up the room impressively. \n\nWalking around his back, you caress his face with one hand and his crotch with the other. You whisper in his ear, "I meant this." "
LIDA.101.a: "Service him"

LIDA.110.t: "Night Visit"
LIDA.110.desc: "In the waning candle light, you are about finished with your nightly reading. Just as you close your book, you hear the light creak of your window pane, amplified by the silence of the night. Turning, you see a shadow entering your room, made ominous by the dim lighting. "Who's there," you manage to say, fighting a primal urge to run away.\n\n"Do not be afraid," they step forward. The smiling figure of [affairs_partner.GetFullNameRegnal] clarifies itself. "You looked lonely earlier today so I've come to pay you a visit.""
LIDA.110.a: ""Well, I don't mind the company...""
LIDA.110.b: ""Get out before I call the guards!""
# sub cums in your shoes
LIDA.120.t: "Sneaky Deposits"
LIDA.120.desc: "You return to your bedchambers and are greeted by the back of a hunched figure in front of your dresser. Curiosity overtakes your first instinct of calling for the guards. The opened windows betrays their method of ingress - #italic that seems like a security risk#!. They notice your entry and stand up abruptly, turning towards you. You vaguely recognize them, made difficult by one of your shoes covering half their face, as #dom one of your subs#!, [affairs_partner.GetFullNameRegnal]. The other shoe of the pair looks ridiculous as a sheath over his cock."
LIDA.120.a: "Intrigued, you leave your clothes out in the open more"
LIDA.120.b: ""Seems like we found a new interest...""
LIDA.120.c: ""What a pathetic cretin""
