It must be fate that we meet on this day. If I may be so bold, I have a proposal that would be desirable for us both." Saying so, he parts his cloak, showing a pouch bulging with presumably gold.

Upon being untied, a lustrous avalanche of coins spill from it and light up the room impressively. \n\nWalking around his back, you caress his face with one hand and his crotch with the other. You whisper in his ear, "I meant this." "

LIDA.110.desc: "In the waning candle light, you are about finished with your nightly reading. Just as you close your book, you hear the light creak of your window pane, amplified by the silence of the night. Turning, you see a shadow entering your room, made ominous by the dim lighting. "Who's there," you manage to say, fighting a primal urge to run away.\n\n"Do not be afraid," they step forward. The smiling figure of [affairs_partner.GetFullNameRegnal] clarifies itself. "You looked lonely earlier today so I've come to pay you a visit.""
LIDA.110.a: ""Well, I don't mind the company...""
LIDA.110.b: ""Get out before I call the guards!""
