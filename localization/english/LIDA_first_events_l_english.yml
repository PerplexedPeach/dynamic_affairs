LIDAf.7.t: "Taste of Heaven in Hell"
LIDAf.7.desc.0: "You descend to [affairs_partner.GetFirstName]'s cell without much ceremony. \n\n"You've come again," he says happily. Laughing, he jests#weak (?)#! "Have you fallen for my cock?" \n\nThat comment strikes a cord within you and you question your repeated visit to your prisoner.

Speaking to the guards, "I need to talk to this prisoner along; you are dismissed." \n\nHe looks up, eyes wide in fear of what tortures you have devised that requires a personal visit.
