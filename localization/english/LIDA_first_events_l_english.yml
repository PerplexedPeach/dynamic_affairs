LIDAf.1.t: "Spicing it Up"
LIDAf.1.desc.0: "You light some candles and sprinkle some scented petals in your bedchamber, making it an even more inviting den of intimacy. As before, you left a cryptic message inviting [affairs_partner.GetFirstName]. \n\nHe arrives promptly, clearly excited with your spontaneous trysts, and only gives a brief greeting before climbing into bed with you."
LIDAf.2.t: "Flowers in Bloom"
LIDAf.2.desc.0: "As it is beautiful day, you have a stroll in your garden. In your bed chambers, you left a note to invite [affairs_partner.GetFirstName] outside. \n\nUpon spotting you, he rushes forward, "What is it you wanted to see me about?" Curious, and a little bit panicked with the cryptic content of your message. \n\nInstead of answering, you beam him your brightest smile, "Let's make love here," pointing to a shaded awning free from prying eyes. \n\nYour strategy to put him on his toes and then deliver such a direct line works and he stands there, flustered at your proposal but not rejecting it."
LIDAf.3.t: "Chains of Command"
LIDAf.3.desc.0: "You send a summons to [affairs_partner.GetFirstName] about helping you with interpreting some passages in your study. By now, that's tacitly understood as an invitation to a tryst, which he gladly accepts. Almost immediately, he shows up in your study."
LIDAf.4.t: "Privileges of Power"
LIDAf.4.desc.0: "You summon [affairs_partner.GetFirstName] to your study, giving instructions to your guards to let him in then leave afterwards. The guards' faces betray their guesses, but you pay them to be discrete thus they make no comments. \n\nEntering the study, "You summoned me, my Lady?" \n\n"Yes, I want to consult with you on this passage here", you say as you reach for one of the books on your bookshelf, making sure that as you do so, one of the straps on your dress would come loose and present your feminine assets. Blushing, they turn away, but you pretend as if you didn't notice and instead walk up to him and say in a coy tone, "Could you help me with this?""
LIDAf.5.t: "Mead in my Room?"
LIDAf.5.desc.0: "It's another long council meeting, and [affairs_partner.GetFirstName]'s councillors start streaming out of the room. You, however, remain in the room and say, "My Lord, I have some more council business to discuss with you." \n\nNodding, he responds, "Very good, I appreciate your enthusiasm and hard work." Taking a pause, "But it's getting late, so let us retire to my bedchambers where we can discuss it in more comfort.""
LIDAf.6.t: "An Intimate Discussion"
LIDAf.6.desc.0: "After the council meeting, [affairs_partner.GetFirstName] dismisses you all. However, you take your time leaving and soon you two are the only ones left in the chamber. "Is there something you need?" he asks amicably. \n\nInstead of answering, you twirl your hair and put an arm under your bosom, making an effort to highlight it. You saunter closer to him and see an inviting amusement in his eyes, "You, my Lord.""
LIDAf.7.t: "Taste of Heaven in Hell"
LIDAf.7.desc.0: "You descend to [affairs_partner.GetFirstName]'s cell without much ceremony. \n\n"You've come again," he says happily. Laughing, he jests#weak (?)#! "Have you fallen for my cock?" \n\nThat comment strikes a cord within you and you question your repeated visit to your prisoner. Initially it was meant as a torture for them, but that is only valid if you deny him the pleasure afterwards. #sub;italic Perhaps you are growing dependent on the pleasure he can provide?#! \n\nPushing such thoughts to the back of your mind, you approach him."
LIDAf.8.t: "The Sweetest Torture"
LIDAf.8.desc.0: "You descend down the stone stairs to your dungeon and muse that giving a prisoner pleasure might be the greatest torture after you take it away. After all, ignore is bliss, and to take away that bliss would be fitting punishment. \n\nIt doesn't take you long before you arrive in front of [affairs_partner.GetFirstName]'s cell. Speaking to the guards, "I need to talk to this prisoner along; you are dismissed." \n\nHe looks up, eyes wide in fear of what tortures you have devised that requires a personal visit. But you also notice a bulge forming in his loose trousers. Before coming, you had your makeup and perfume done in a manner bordering on garish (and some would call #sub whorish#!), the kind that instantly sparks men's loins and their desire to dominate and conquer."
LIDAf.9.t: "Who Owns Who"
LIDAf.9.desc.0: "Communicating via your servants, you inform [affairs_partner.GetFirstName] that you'd like to get to know them better in your sitting room. Wise to your intentions, he wastes no time arriving, noting the lack of servants and guards to confirm his guess. \n\nYou lock eyes, and without exchanging any words do all the communication with your bodies."
LIDAf.10.t: "A Chance Encounter"
LIDAf.10.desc.0: "Your servants inform you that [affairs_partner.GetFirstName] is strolling along your courtyard. You give further instructions to clear out the guards and any other personage near that location. A knowing gleam appears in their eyes, but they are paid for their discretion and so bow and leave without any comment. \n\nYou find him in the expected location, and feigning like you were strolling as well, you don't go towards him. \n\n"Well met, [ROOT.Char.GetFullNameRegnal]!" He greets you enthusiastically. \n\nSmiling, you reply, "[affairs_partner.GetFirstName], no need to stand on formality. Fate has ordained that we meet today, it must mean that we should get to know each other more intimately." Your painted lips and inviting body language draws them in with no chance of escape."
